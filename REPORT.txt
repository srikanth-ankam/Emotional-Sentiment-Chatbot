📌 Project Title:
  Emotional Sentiment Analysis and Adaptive Response System  

---

🧠 Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a prototype chatbot that can:
1. Identify the   emotional state   (joy, sadness, anxiety, stress, etc.) of a user from conversational input.
2. Generate   empathetic responses   that are context-aware and culturally sensitive.

This tool has potential applications in digital mental health support, virtual assistants, and personalized conversational AI systems.

📂 Dataset

  File Used  : `extended.csv`

- Consists of ~50 manually labeled conversation lines.
- Each line is tagged with one of the following emotional states:
  - `joy`, `sadness`, `stress`, `anxiety`
- Preprocessing Steps:
  - Removed noise and punctuation
  - Standardized case
  - Cleaned mislabels and inconsistent categories

Chatbot Flow

1. User types a message.
2. Model predicts the emotion using a pre-trained classifier.
3. Based on emotion, chatbot generates a context-sensitive reply.

🧩 Challenges Faced

- ❌ Accuracy Limitations:  
  With a small dataset and no fine-tuning, the model achieved only   77.15% accuracy  .
  
- ❌ Cultural Sensitivity:  
  The model is trained on global (non-Indian) datasets. Some responses were not relevant in Indian social context.

- ❌ Model Compatibility Issues:  
  Faced issues with Keras 3 incompatibility in Transformers. Solved by switching model or using PyTorch backend.

📊 Evaluation Results

Using `evaluate_chatbot.py` with `test_cases.json`:

- Overall Accuracy: `77.15%`
- Correct Predictions: 7 out of 10
- Observations: Model often confused between `anxiety` and `stress`. Clear separation was hard without fine-tuning...

🌱 Future Improvements

- 🧠 Context Awareness:  
  Integrate previous conversation history for better emotional context.

- 🌍 Cultural Adaptation:  
  Include Hinglish, Telugu-English, or regional sentiment expressions.

- 🔤 Multilingual Support:  
  Extend to support local languages and dialects using Indic NLP libraries.
